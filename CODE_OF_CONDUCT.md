# Code of Conduct

This project and community space is governed by a simple principle: **be kind, be clear, be constructive.**

We are a user-driven group working together to make Plex better through signal-boosted feedback. To that end, all contributors are expected to follow these standards of behavior.

## ⚖️ Enforcement

Reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be flagged in GitHub or brought to the attention of project moderators. We reserve the right to remove any content or contributors that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

This is a community effort. If you see something that doesn’t feel right, speak up—or support someone who does.
