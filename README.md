# Plex Community Issue Tracker

Welcome! This is a **community-led issue tracker** designed to improve the quality, clarity, and visibility of bugs and feature requests for the Plex Media Player rebuild and public beta period.

We're a group of Plex users who believe feedback shouldn't get lost in a sea of forum threads and guesswork. While we are **not affiliated with the official Plex team**, our goal is to organize high-signal reports that can ultimately help the Plex team—and the wider user base.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Centralize** bug reports and feature suggestions for the Plex media player.
- **Filter noise** from community feedback by using structured GitHub issue forms.
- **Encourage adoption** by Plex through clean, consistent, and actionable user-submitted data.
- **Foster collaboration** among users via GitHub Issues, Discussions, and Projects.
- **Promote searchability** through structured input, consistent labels, and scoped Projects.

## 🧽 How We Organize Feedback

- **📂 Issues** — Our main intake method. Bugs and features are logged via structured forms. Using dropdowns and labels ensures that issues are easier to sort, group, and find later.
- **💬 Discussions** — Not a replacement for the Plex forums! These are for:

  - Side conversations and exploration that fork off existing issues
  - Reports that are incomplete or vague but worth follow-up
  - Coordination among contributors on how to categorize or reframe an issue

- **📋 Projects** — Used like pivot tables: we track bugs or enhancements specific to platforms (e.g., Apple TV, Android) or specific Plex versions. This makes patterns and trends easier to surface.
- **🏷 Labels** — Automatically applied to sort by platform, frequency, severity, media type, and more. Helps streamline searching and filtering.

## 🙌 Why This Matters

We know reporting issues can feel thankless. Our hope is this tracker:

- Makes reporting easier
- Surfaces recurring problems faster
- Builds a bridge Plex might one day walk across
- Makes it easier for the community (and hopefully Plex) to **search, filter, and act** on what matters most

Whether you're here to fix, suggest, or just keep track: thanks for helping make Plex better for all of us.
