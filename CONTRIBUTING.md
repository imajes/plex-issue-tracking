# Contributing to the Plex Community Issue Tracker

Thanks for jumping in! This is a **user-led space** where we gather and structure bugs, feature requests, and feedback around the Plex Media Player rebuild. We're not the official Plex team, but we _are_ dedicated to making our feedback clear, useful, and hard to ignore.

Below are some guidelines to help keep things helpful, organized, and respectful for everyone.

---

## 🌟 What Makes a Great Contribution

**✔ Clear and Complete**
Use the provided issue forms. They help ensure reports are searchable, categorized, and easy to act on.

**✔ Focused**
Stick to one bug or one feature per issue. This keeps discussions and tracking clean.

**✔ Honest & Respectful**
We're all here to help. Keep your tone civil, kind, and constructive. Frustration is valid—abuse isn't. No hostility, hate speech, or personal attacks will be tolerated.

**✔ Empathy First**
Assume good intent. This is a collaborative effort by volunteers. Treat each other with patience and empathy.

**✔ Search Before You Post**
Use GitHub search and the labels/tags to check if your issue already exists. You can comment or react on existing issues to add your voice.

**✔ Keep Discussions in the Right Channel**
If you're unsure about your report, or want to discuss something more loosely, start a GitHub **Discussion** instead of opening an issue.

> ⚠️ For general-purpose discussions about Plex (e.g., how to set something up, server advice, or broader product feedback), please use the **official [Plex Forums](https://forums.plex.tv/)**. This repo is focused strictly on **public beta feedback and media player rebuild issues**.

## 🛠 Contribution Pathways

### 🛮 Bugs

Found a problem? Use the **Bug Report** form to share clear steps, affected platforms, and expected vs actual results.

### 💡 Features

Have an idea? Use the **Feature Request** form to explain the problem you're solving, not just the UI you're imagining.

### 💬 Discussions

Got something less structured to talk through? Use **Discussions** for that. Especially useful for vague issues or idea-storming before making a formal issue.

## 🌐 Why It Matters

Structured, respectful feedback isn’t just easier to act on—it's easier to find, organize, and prioritize. The more we work together, the more likely it is that Plex (or any other devs watching) take notice.

Thanks for being part of this.
